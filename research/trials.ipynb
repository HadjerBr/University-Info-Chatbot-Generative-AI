Harvard College offers a four-year undergraduate, liberal arts program for students\\nseeking their first degree. There are about 6,600 undergraduates at the College, with nearly\\nequal numbers of men and women. In addition to Harvard College, Harvard University\\nincludes 12 graduate and professional schools, all of which offer programs for students who\\nalready hold their first degrees and seek advanced training in their fields through master\\'s or\\ndoctoral programs. All 12 graduate and professional schools maintain their own admissions\\noffices and teaching faculties, and they are run independently of Harvard College. For\\ninformation about Harvard\\'s graduate programs, please contact these schools\\' admissions\\noffices directly.\\nWhat is a \"liberal arts & sciences\" education?\\n\\nCommitment to liberal arts & sciences is at the core of Harvard College\\'s mission: before\\nstudents can help change the world, they need to understand it. The liberal arts & sciences\\noffer a broad intellectual foundation for the tools to think critically, reason analytically and\\nwrite clearly. These proficiencies will prepare students to navigate the world\\'s most complex\\nissues, and address future innovations with unforeseen challenges. Shaped by ideas\\nencountered and created, these new modes of thinking will prepare students for leading\\nmeaningful lives, with conscientious global citizenship, to enhance the greater good.\\n Harvard offers General Education courses that show the liberal arts and sciences in action.\\nThey pose enduring questions, they frame urgent problems, and they help students see that\\nno one discipline can answer those questions or grapple with those problems on its own.\\nStudents are challenged to ask difficult questions, explore unfamiliar concepts, and indulge\\nin their passion for inquiry and discovery across disciplines.\\nCourses\\nHow easy is it to change my concentration?\\n\\nAbout a third of undergraduates change fields after declaring their concentrations, which\\nstudents do midway through their sophomore year. You would simply change concentrations\\nin consultation with your departmental advisers. Learn more about the breadth of Harvard\\'s\\nacademic programs.\\nAre there required first-year classes?\\n\\nHarvard requires all first-year students to fulfill the expository writing requirement, a one- or\\ntwo-semester course depending on placement. Otherwise, you may enroll in any Harvard\\nCollege courses in which you are interested and for which you are prepared.\\nHow many courses does Harvard offer?\\n\\nHarvard offers more than 3,700 courses. For a complete copy of the course catalog, please\\nvisit registrar.fas.harvard.edu.\\nAre there exchange programs with other Greater Boston\\ncolleges?\\n\\nYou may cross-register in courses offered at MIT, which is a 10-minute trip from Harvard\\nYard. You may also enroll in graduate-level courses at the Graduate School of Arts and\\nSciences as well as at many of Harvard\\'s professional schools.'),\n",

Credentials\\nsuch as the International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma, Advanced Placement (AP)\\n examinations, and other international credentials earned in secondary school can serve as\\nvaluable placement tools, and in some cases may be used to fulfill the language requirement.\\nHarvard College does not grant degree credit for these kinds of pre-matriculation\\ncredentials.\\nCan I concentrate in business, journalism, law, or medicine?\\n\\nWhile you can take courses related to these fields, Harvard's academic programs are not pre-\\nprofessional, in that they do not provide vocational training. Many Harvard graduates plan to\\ncontinue their education in professional or graduate schools, often in these fields. Please\\nnote that both medicine and law are postgraduate programs in the United States. If you are\\nnot a U.S. citizen but wish to continue your education in a professional program, particularly\\nin an American medical school, we advise you to consult specific graduate and professional\\nprograms in advance to understand those schools' admissions and financial aid policies\\nconcerning international students.\\nWhat should I know about Harvard's science and engineering\\nprograms?\\n\\nScience and engineering have long been priorities at Harvard. There are more than two\\ndozen state-of-the-art facilities for science research at Harvard, and new computer science\\nand chemistry laboratories opened in 2008. Moreover, forty-one of our former and current\\nscience faculty members have won Nobel Prizes. About half of recent entering students\\nintend to major in the natural sciences, engineering, computer science or mathematics. Read\\nmore about engineering and applied science at www.seas.harvard.edu.\\nFaculty\\nWhat percentage of faculty members teach undergraduates?\\n\\nVirtually 100 percent.\\nIs it possible to get to know my professors?\\n\\nYes. In addition to weekly office hours, students often spend time with their professors\\nbefore and after class. There are also many occasions when professors take meals in\\nHarvard's 12 residential dining halls; attend gatherings in the residences of Faculty Deans,\\n who are themselves Harvard faculty members; and participate in other programs and special\\nevents.\\nHow large are classes?\\n\\nSome introductory courses as well as several other popular courses have large enrollments.\\nYet, the median class size at Harvard is 12. Of the nearly 1,300 courses offered last fall, for\\nexample, more than 1,000 of them enrolled 20 or fewer students.\\nCampus Life\\nWhat security measures are in place at Harvard?\\n\\nHarvard has a comprehensive public safety program that includes a full campus police force,\\na walking escort service, a campus-wide shuttle service, emergency phones, lighted\\npathways and a computer-card key system operating in all residential buildings. Read\\nHarvard's Annual Security Report on the Harvard University Police Department website.\\nIs on-campus housing guaranteed?\\n\\nHarvard guarantees housing for all four years. First-year students live in one of the 17\\ndormitories in or adjacent to historic Harvard Yard. Self-selected groups of students are\\nassigned to one of 12 residential Houses for the final three years of undergraduate study.\"),\n",

A very small percentage of\\nstudents choose to live off-campus their following years. Most students and alumni consider\\nthe House system one of the hallmarks of their Harvard experiences. Considering the\\ndiversity of student backgrounds, interests, and talents, Harvard's residential program\\nenhances the degree to which students learn from one another.\\nWhat will my room look like?\\n Most first-year dorms have suites for three to six students. Suites contain from two to four\\nbedrooms and a common room. A few have their own baths, though most share a bathroom\\nwith other suites. The First-Year Experience Office assigns students to suites rather than to\\nparticular bedrooms, and in almost any suite students should expect to share a bedroom for\\nat least part of the first year. Some dorms contain doubles, usually one fairly large room with\\na shared bath.\\nWhere will I take my meals?\\n\\nFirst-year students all eat together in Annenberg Hall. During sophomore through senior year,\\nstudents typically eat in the dining hall located within their Houses, although students can\\nchoose to eat at other House dining halls as well. See more about dining.\\nWhat extracurricular opportunities are available?\\n\\nThere are more than 450 student-run organizations at Harvard, among them dozens of\\npublications, five orchestras, an extensive community service program, more than 40\\nintercollegiate athletic teams, and a broad assortment of other activitiesÐartistic, musical,\\npolitical, and social. We encourage and support extracurricular opportunities as these\\nprovide important settings for personal growth and friendships. Visit the Dean of Students\\nwebsite for more information about extracurriculars.\\nResources\\nWhat advising and support services are available?\\n\\nWoven into Harvard's residences are a variety of academic and other advising resources that\\nmake the residential experience at Harvard distinctive. First-year students benefit from the\\nguidance that resident proctors provide about living in Cambridge and studying at the\\nCollege. Each House also has its own staff of advisers called resident tutors who are similar\\nto first-year proctors but with expertise in particular academic and professional fields.\\nHarvard offers extensive advising resources of other kinds. If you need extra help in\\ncoursework, you can turn to the Academic Resource Center. The Mignone Center for Career\\nSuccess (MCS) offers career counseling. The University maintains its own outstanding health\\nservices. The Undergraduate Financial Aid Office will help you with financial aid issues, and\\nthe Student Employment Office will help place you in jobs on and off campus. Finally, if you\\nare an international student, the International Office is there for your special needs.\\n Does Harvard provide services if I have a disability?\\n\\nYes. The Disability Access Office (DAO)Ðformerly the Accessible Education Office (AEO)Ð\\nassists students with any impairment limiting their ability to walk, see, hear, speak, learn, or\\nwrite. Based on each student's successful strategies, the Center collaborates with faculty\\nand staff to ensure individualized accommodation. Accessible housing and transportation\\nare also available.

When you do so, we will also\\nreceive the full results from your best sitting, including highest composite from a single test\\ndate.\\nCan I self-report my test scores?\\n\\nYes. Applicants may provide self-reported test scores. Admitted students who self-report\\nSAT and ACT scores and decide to enroll at Harvard College will be required to submit\\nofficial SAT and ACT test scores upon enrolling. Other test scores will be reviewed through\\nthe final transcript review process.

You may find it helpful to\\nutilize free-test prep from Khan Academy or join a free SAT bootcamp on Schoolhouse.world.\\nThe ACT and College Board provide sample tests to practice. Such free programs could help\\nstudents from under-resourced schools by providing the academic tools that will serve them\\nwell on standardized tests and also in college.

What if it would be a financial\\nhardship for me to access a SAT or ACT test site elsewhere?\\n\\nThe Admissions Committee does not expect applicants to go to extraordinary measures to\\naccess SAT or ACT test sites. If students attend schools that offer SAT or ACT testing onsite,\\nor live or attend schools close to accessible test sites, we will expect them to take the tests\\nand submit scores with their Harvard application. However, if students do not have access to\\nnearby test sites, the Admissions Committee still welcomes applications from these\\nstudents. We encourage students in that situation to submit results from other standardized\\ntests to which they have greater access.

For instance, students\\nlacking access to the SAT or ACT may submit AP results or IB/GCSE/A-level/other national\\nleaving exam predictions or results.\\nWhy did Harvard decide to require standardized testing again?\\n\\nThe decision to return to requiring testing was motivated by a number of important new\\ninsights, including research led by Harvard faculty members that confirms the role of\\nstandardized testing to help predict college and post-college success for students, including\\nthose from less-resourced backgrounds, particularly when considered together with other\\nacademic credentials. We also know that, when given the choice, many applicants choose\\nnot to submit scores. This can disadvantage some students, including low-income and\\nminority applicants, who also may be disadvantaged in other aspects of their application\\nbecause of lack of academic opportunity.\\nMore information about an applicant, especially such strongly predictive information, can be\\nvaluable. Reinstating a testing requirement will bring important and consistent information\\nback into the admissions process. In Harvard's whole-person review process, testing is just\\none data point among many considered carefully with the expertise of the admissions\\ncommittee.\\nWe recognize that this requirement brings certain challenges.

In addition to providing alternative test options\\nfor those who cannot access the SAT or ACT, Harvard College Admissions provides\\ninformation on sources for no-cost tutoring and test preparation.\\nWhich standardized tests does Harvard require?\\n Harvard requires the SAT or ACT to meet its standardized testing requirement.

Harvard has\\nfound that SAT and ACT scores are the best predictors of Harvard grades. The Committee\\nalso understands that SAT and ACT tests are one aspect of a student's application.\\nAdmissions officers take into consideration that not all students attend well-resourced\\nschools throughout their lives, and that those who come from modest economic\\nbackgrounds or first-generation college families may have had fewer opportunities to prepare\\nfor standardized tests.

Our overall graduation rate of 98%, among the highest in the\\nnation, is perhaps due in part to the fact that so many students take time off, before or\\nduring college.\\nThe admissions committee encourages admitted students to defer enrollment for one year to\\ntravel, pursue a special project or activity, work, or spend time in another meaningful way.\\nPlease be aware that you may not enroll as a degree or diploma candidate in a university or\\nsecondary school during your interval year.

You can find them here:\\nhttps://college.harvard.edu/financial-aid/apply-financial-aid. There is no special additional\\napplication for our aid expansion.\\nWhat is Harvard's financial aid expansion for the 25-26 school\\nyear?\\n\\nIn brief: starting in the 2025-26 academic year, Harvard College will be free for students from\\nfamilies with incomes of $100,000 or less and tuition-free for students from families with\\nannual incomes of $200,000 or less. Many students from families with incomes over\\n$200,000 will also qualify for financial aid. These thresholds assume typical assets and a\\ntypical US cost of living and taxes - those families who have assets will pay more than those\\nwithout, and those with a lower cost of living and/or taxes will pay more than a family with a\\ntypical cost of living and taxes.\\nRead more on our website: https://college.harvard.edu/financial-aid\\nWhat does tuition-free mean?\\n\\nA family that is tuition-free has a grant that covers the full cost of tuition for the year.\\nStudents will still see a tuition charge on their bill - they will just also see that the total cost\\nof tuition has been covered by grant. Depending on the individual financial aid package, a\\n family may still need to pay housing, food, and other fees, but at minimum tuition will be\\ncovered.\\nDoes Harvard's financial aid expansion apply to graduate\\nstudents?\\n\\nThe information on this webpage applies to Harvard College undergraduate students, and\\nour financial aid expansion applies only to Harvard College undergraduates. Each graduate\\nschool, as well as the Harvard Extension School have their own financial aid office and\"),\n",

Our new aid program will apply to all Harvard College undergraduates in all class years.\\nIt also applies in the same way to students admitted as transfer students. Admitted students\\nwho have already received an estimate of their financial aid eligibility for the 25-26 school\\nyear will have their decisions updated to reflect the new policy around April 1. Currently\\nenrolled students will have this policy applied as part of the regular aid application process\\nfor 25-26 (for which applications are generally due May 1).\\nChallenging Circumstances\\nWhat if my family's financial situation changes while I am\\nattending Harvard?\\n\\nYou may request a review of your financial aid decision at any time to accommodate\\nsignificant changes in your family's financial situation. You must apply for financial aid each\\nyear. We will meet your demonstrated need for all four years.\\nCan I apply for Harvard's financial aid independently of my\\nparents?\\n\\nNo, in 99% of the cases. We feel strongly that your parents have an obligation to help finance\\nyour college education. Our aid is available only to students whose families would not\\notherwise be able to send them to Harvard.\\n What if my parents refuse to pay for my college education?\\n\\nTo be fair to all our students, we can base our financial aid decisions only on ability and not\\nwillingness to pay, and a decision to attend Harvard must be made by you and your parents.\\nPlease contact the Financial Aid Office to discuss this further if you have questions or\\nconcerns.\\nCost of Attendance\\nWhat's the difference between aroom and boardo and ahousing\\nand foodo?\\n\\nFor many years we have used the term aroomo to represent the cost of housing at Harvard,\\nand aboardo to represent the cost of the meal plan. Students were charged aroomo and\\naboardo fees as part of their student term bill, and received aid towards aroom and boardo\\ncosts. The Department of Education has asked that schools change this language to\\nahousingo and afoodo costs. This is simply a language change meant to make costs clearer\\nand easier to understand; there has been no change to how housing or meals work at\\nHarvard, or to the amounts charged and used in financial aid calculations.\\nWhat is the abooks and supplieso portion of my financial aid\\npackage?\\n\\nThe cost of attendance used in calculating financial aid packages includes a standard\\nestimate of what you will spend on books, course materials, supplies, and equipment. This is\\nan `unbilled' or `out-of-pocket' expense, meaning that you will purchase your own books and\\nsupplies ± you will not see a charge for books and supplies on your term bill.\\nJobs\\nAm I required to work if I am an international student and I\\nqualify for financial aid?\\n\\nThere is no requirement to work. However, all students, international or American, who\\ndemonstrate financial need will have a student term-time work expectation as part of their\\nfinancial aid package, which they can typically meet by working 10-12 hours per week. U.S.\\nimmigration regulations allow foreign nationals to work on-campus only, and they restrict the\"),\n",

Jobs are plentiful and are often interesting and relevant to\\nacademic interests.\\nIs it easy to find a student job on or near campus?\\n\\nJobs are plentiful at Harvard. Employment opportunities range from dining hall duties to work\\nin the University's libraries, laboratories, and offices. Students have also earned money on\\ncampus as bartenders, teaching assistants, sportswriters, computer programmers, lifeguards\\nand research assistants, to cite a few examples. Working eight to twelve hours on average\\nper week, most students find that they can work, excel academically, and participate in a\\nrange of extracurricular activities. Read more at our Student Employment Office website.\\nWhat is the Federal Work-Study Program (FWSP)?\\n\\nWhen you apply for aid, your financial aid package will indicate your eligibility for the Federal\\nWork-Study Program (FWSP). The Federal Work-Study Program subsidizes the wages of\\neligible students, making them particularly attractive to employers. If you are eligible, you will\\nbe able to work in FWSP-designated jobs at the University (and sometimes off campus as\\nwell). FWSP funds are available for both term-time and summer employment. Browse the\\nStudent Employment Office jobs database for FWSP eligible jobs.\\nWhat is a Term-Time Work Expectation?\\n\\nThe term-time work expectation is an unbilled cost listed on your award letter. It is the\\namount of earnings during the academic year that we expect you to contribute toward your\\ncollege costs. All earnings are paid directly to you, and it will be your responsibility to\\ndetermine what portion of your earnings will be used towards billed (tuition, fees, housing\\nand food, etc.) and/or non-billed (transportation and personal expenses, etc.)\\nexpenses. Students can work while at Harvard, but only some students are eligible for the\\nFederal Work-Study Program (FWSP). Your financial aid portal will designate whether you\\ncan work in a job funded by FWSP or need to focus your job search on positions not funded\\nby the program. Students may use outside awards or loans to replace their expected\\ncontribution.\\nLoans\\nWhere can I find parent financing information?\\n Many of our families find parent loans to be a useful tool for spreading the cost of education\\nover a number of years. Parents may borrow up to the full cost of education, less any other\\nfinancial aid. Parent loans are not based on financial need, and there are no income\\nrestrictions or penalties for early repayment. Harvard processes PLUS loans directly with the\\nU.S. Department of Education through the Federal Direct Lending Program, without the need\\nfor banks and for-profit lenders. However, your financing options are not limited to the parent\\nPLUS loan; you and your family may borrow from any lender you choose.\\nAre loans available if I choose not to work?\\n\\nMost students do choose to work. If you will have heavy extracurricular demands on your\\ntime (such as playing football in the fall or acting in a spring drama production), you could\\nchoose to meet the job expectation partially or completely through student loans.\\nOutside Awards\\nWhat is considered an outside award?\\n\\nIn assessing your financial need, we first look at your family's particular income and assets in\\norder to come up with a student and parent contribution based on your individual financial\\nneed. Any funds that you receive from an organization outside your family that are intended\\nfor your educational expenses would be considered outside awards. Since outside awards\\nare additional resources that reduce your financial need, they cannot be used to replace your\\nparent contribution (which was calculated based on your parents' income and assets).\\nHere are some examples of outside awards:\"),\n",

You\\nHarvard scholarship funding is not an outside award. Student wages, thesis grants, summer\\nresearch grants, and other similar grants are not outside awards, since they are not directly\\n meant to pay your standard cost of attendance. If you are receiving funding from an outside\\norganization and are unclear of how to report it, please contact us and we'll let you know.\\nWhat happens to my financial aid award if I receive additional\\noutside assistance?\\n\\nA large percentage of each entering first-year class receives one or more outside awards\\nfrom national or local organizations. When adjusting the Harvard financial aid package, 100%\\nof the total outside award amount is first deducted from your work expectation. If the total of\\noutside awards exceeds your work expectation, that excess amount is deducted from the\\nHarvard Scholarship. Since outside awards are additional resources that help to meet need,\\nthey may not be used to replace your parents' contribution or other expected family resource.\\nFor example, if you were originally offered a financial aid package with a $3,500 job, and a\\n$15,000 Harvard Scholarship and subsequently receive a $2,000 National Merit award and\\n$1,000 from the Elks Club, then we will reduce your term-time job expectation to $500. Only\\nif outside awards exceeded $3,500 would they have any impact upon the amount of Harvard\\nScholarship.\\nWhat do I need to do to report outside award(s)?\\n\\nIf you expect to receive an outside scholarship that is not reflected on your award letter,\\nincluding tuition benefits from parents' employers, you should report it to the Financial Aid\\nOffice by visiting the Outside Award Reporting System (OARS). This is found under the\\nFinancial Aid tab of your My.Harvard student portal. We will adjust the financial aid package\\nto reflect the receipt of additional resources.\\nWhere should I send outside award checks?\\n\\nChecks are processed by the Student Accounts Office (not the Financial Aid Office). Please\\nsend your checks to:\\nStudent Accounts Office\\nAttn: Outside Awards\\n801 Smith Campus Center\\n1350 Massachusetts Ave.\\nCambridge, MA 02138\\n617-495-2739\\n Where should I send Cost of Attendance or Verification of\\nEnrollment forms?\\n\\nIf an outside organization requires you to complete a Cost of Attendance or Verification of\\nEnrollment form, and it needs to be signed by an official at Harvard, please direct the form\\naccordingly:\\nCost of Attendance Forms:\\nHarvard College\\nGriffin Financial Aid Office\\nAttn: Outside Award Coordinator\\n86 Brattle Street\\nCambridge, MA 02138\\nVerification of Enrollment:\"),\n",

You are responsible for booking and paying for your own travel, and you may\\nfind that you pay more or less than our estimate. Many students will use the money they earn\\nover the summer to meet the costs of travel to and from Harvard. Personal Expenses: The\\nestimated cost for books, supplies, clothing, laundry, telephone, entertainment, local\\ntransportation, and other incidentals has been included in the personal expenses portion of\\nyour budget. Students generally spend between $600-$800 on books over the course of\\nboth semesters. You are responsible for paying your own personal expenses. Many of the\\nstudents will use money earned at their term-time jobs to cover personal expenses.\\nDo my financial aid documents have to be in English?\\n\\nWe require English translation for all financial aid documents. Documents do not, however,\\nneed to be translated by an official translator. Most students will save the cost of paying a\\ntranslator and simply write the translation directly on the documents themselves.\\nWhat should I do if my permanent address changes?\\n Please email us and inform us of your new address. You will also need to file a change of\\naddress with the Student Data Office in the Office of the Registrar.\\nI am undocumented. Am I still eligible for financial aid?\\n\\nYes.

As expenses can vary greatly based on each student's discretion, we are not able to\\nmeet every student's individual expenses. Rather, we build an allowance toward them in your\\n budget, but leave the daily choices to you. For instance, in regard to local travel expenses, we\\nmight be able to offer you financial aid toward commuting from your apartment to your\\nschool campus, but we wouldn't be able to offer you scholarship toward a traveling tour that\\nis separate from your program.

In\\naddition, since the armed forces require a high school diploma or GED to enlist, they may be\\nable to assist you in confirming your graduation status.\\n Veterans Financial Aid\\nIs the financial aid application process the same for a veteran as\\nit is for a non-veteran student?\\n\\nYes. All aid applicants should follow the same set of application instructions. Harvard\\nCollege acknowledges the unique contributions each admitted student brings to our learning\\ncommunity. We are therefore committed to equitable treatment through one comprehensive\\nneed-based financial aid program.\\nWhen a veteran completes the FAFSA, the Federal Government\\nmay categorize that student as an aindependent student.o Why is\\nHarvard College requesting financial information for parent(s) if\\nthe Federal Government considers the student \"independent?\"\\n\\nA student may be deemed \"independent\" for federal purposes for a variety of reasons,\\nincluding having veteran status. Harvard College maintains its own financial aid program and\\npolicies, and it is our institutional philosophy that every student\\'s parents have a\\nresponsibility to contribute to their child\\'s educational expenses. We therefore begin by\\nasking all aid applicants to provide information for both parents.\\nHowever, we are committed to working with any student on an individual basis to learn more\\nabout complex, unusual, or challenging circumstances that are not easily described in the\\nstandard aid application. If any aid applicant cannot ask one or both of their parents to\\nparticipate in the financial aid process, the applicant should complete the Parent\\nInformation Sheet and submit it as part of their financial aid application.\\nHow can a veteran report unusual circumstances as a part of\\ntheir financial aid application (such as unusual debts, liabilities,\\nor anything else that may not be captured by the application)?\\n\\nThere are many avenues to provide more information on your specific financial\\ncircumstances. When completing the CSS Profile, there is a dedicated section that allows\\nany applicant to expand upon their specific situation. Applicants may also upload a brief\\naspecial circumstanceso letter through IDOC when they are submitting their tax documents.\\nIn addition, all applicants are encouraged to contact the Griffin Financial Aid Office and work\\nwith one of our Financial Aid Officers, both during the application process and throughout\\ntheir time at Harvard, to discuss their circumstances.\\n Would a veteran be eligible for additional financial aid if they\\nhave unusually high expenses due to living off-campus?\\n\\nIf a student has VA Benefits that they will use while attending\\nHarvard College, what does that process look like?\\n\\nThe Griffin Financial Aid Office works in conjunction with Harvard University Student\\nFinancial Services (SFS) to complete the certification process for any student who elects to\\nuse VA benefits. An outline of the process can be found here, and there is also a helpful aVA\\nand Military FAQso page on the SFS website here. Once a student has obtained their\\nCertificate of Eligibility, we would ask them to contact our office at faoinfo@fas.harvard.edu\\nfor information on next steps.\\nIn general, we encourage students to contact our office directly if they have specific\\nquestions about how their VA benefits might interact with financial aid.'),\n",

The results of this test are very useful to the Committee as it\\nconsiders international applicants. Official tests results must be submitted electronically to\\nthe Admissions Office from the ETS (code#3434). We do not require SAT, ACT or AP scores\\nto be submitted in order to apply to the Visiting Undergraduate Student Program. However,\\nwe encourage students who have taken them to submit their scores, because all information\\nabout a candidate is helpful in the admissions process.\\nI am from another country but I speak English proficiently. Do I\\nstill need to take the TOEFL?\\n\\nOnly applicants to the Visiting Undergraduate Students program are required to submit the\\nTOEFL. It is not a requirement for first-year and transfer applicants.\\nWithout all of the information about a VUS candidate, we cannot make exceptions to this\\nrequirement and time constraints do not allow us to pre-screen all applicants to determine if\\nthey are exempt from taking the TOEFL. Therefore, we advise all VUS applicants whose\\nnative language is not English to take the TOEFL and submit the results.'),\n",

Through a diverse\\nliving environment, where students live with people who are studying different topics, come from\\ndifferent walks of life, and have evolving identities, intellectual transformation is deepened, and\\nconditions for social transformation are created. From this we hope that students will begin to\\nfashion their lives by gaining a sense of what they want to do with their gifts and talents,\\nassessing their values and interests, and learning how they can best serve the world.\\n\\nHONOR CODE\\nHarvard College is an academic and residential community devoted to learning and the creation\\nof knowledge. We — the academic community of Harvard College, including the faculty and\\nstudents — view integrity as the basis for intellectual discovery, artistic creation, independent\\nscholarship, and meaningful collaboration. We thus hold honesty — in the representation of our\\nwork and in our interactions with teachers, advisors, peers, and students — as the foundation of\\nour community.\\n\\nMembers of the Harvard College community commit themselves to producing\\nacademic work of integrity — that is, work that adheres to the scholarly and\\nintellectual standards of accurate attribution of sources, appropriate collection\\nand use of data, and transparent acknowledgment of the contributions of others\\nto their ideas, discoveries, interpretations, and conclusions. Cheating on exams\\nor problem sets, plagiarizing or misrepresenting the ideas or language of\\nsomeone else as one’s own, falsifying data, or any other instance of academic\\ndishonesty violates the standards of our community, as well as the standards of\\nthe wider world of learning and affairs.\\n\\nA fundamental goal of the College is to foster an environment in which its members may\\nlive and work productively together, making use of the rich resources of the University in\\nindividual and collective pursuit of academic excellence, extracurricular accomplishment,\\nand personal challenge.\\n\\nFor this goal to be achieved, the community must be a tolerant and supportive one,\\ncharacterized by civility and consideration for others. Therefore, the standards and expectations\\nof this community are high, as much so in the quality of interpersonal relationships as they are\\nin academic performance.'),\n",

Each term includes\\napproximately 13 weeks of scheduled classes, a 6- to 7-day reading period, and a 9-day\\nexamination period. Regardless of format, each course will require a minimum of 3 hours of\\nwork for each unit of credit, an average total of at least 12 hours of work each week for the\\nstandard 4-credit course. This includes all in-person course meetings and work completed\\noutside of scheduled academic exercises. Academic exercises are defined as any instructional\\ncomponents associated with courses, including but not limited to discussion sections, lectures,\\nand laboratory sections.\\nHarvard College offers an in-person, residential education where students live together and\\nlearn together—both inside and outside of the classroom. In keeping with the residential mission\\nof the College, active engagement in the classroom setting is essential. Regular, in-person\\nattendance at academic exercises is expected of all students. Students are expected to remain\\nin the immediate vicinity of Cambridge throughout the academic year, with the exception of\\nscheduled vacations and holidays. In most cases, students absent for more than two weeks in\\nany one term may be placed on involuntary leave of absence.\\nCLASSROOM SOCIAL COMPACT\\nA Harvard College education is defined by the pursuit of knowledge. The classroom forms the\\ncenter of a Harvard College education, and students are expected to prioritize their coursework.\\nAcademic excellence requires students to participate in a thoughtful, candid, and free exchange\\nof ideas. A successful classroom depends on student attendance, attentiveness, and active\\nintellectual engagement. Students should approach learning with curiosity, intellectual\\nopenness, respect for new ideas and for other people’s perspectives. Students should expect\\nregularly to encounter evidence, analysis, interpretations, and opinions that challenge their point\\nof view. Student speech, assignments, and exams can be evaluated by instructors as factually\\nincorrect or poorly argued, for example—but a student’s status in a course, including their\\ngrades, will not be affected by their political or ethical point of view.\\nAs a default, no member of a course—instructors or students—should post on social media (or\\nshare information that enables others to post) identifiable student classroom statements without\\nwritten consent. Likewise, class participants should assume that, while they may discuss\\nclassroom conversations outside of class, they may not attribute ideas to a specific student\\nwithout that student’s written consent. Confidentiality policies do not override Harvard’s Non-\\nDiscrimination, Anti-Bullying, & Other Professional Conduct Policies.\\nREQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE\\nThe Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) offers undergraduates a wide range of courses to\\nsatisfy individual objectives and interests. In defining the requirements for the Bachelor of Arts\\n(A.B.) and Bachelor of Science (S.B.) degrees, the Faculty has sought to accommodate those\\nobjectives and interests, and, at the same time, to establish a framework for study in the College\\nthat ensures involvement with important areas of general knowledge (the General Education\\nrequirements) and in-depth study of one specific area (the concentration requirement). In\\naddition, students must demonstrate competence in certain skills reflective of the complex'),\n",

Students are responsible for knowing the rules\\nthat apply to their candidacy for the A.B. or S.B. degree.\\n\\nExceptions to the rules may be made only by special vote of the Administrative Board of\\nHarvard College (hereafter referred to as the Administrative Board) or by those administrative\\nofficers or committees to which the Faculty, for certain matters, has delegated authority to act\\non its behalf.\\n\\nCREDIT REQUIREMENTS\\nAll candidates for the A.B. or the S.B. degree must pass 128 credits (the equivalent of 32\\n4-credit courses) and receive letter grades of C– or higher in at least 84 of those credits (at\\nleast 96 credits to be eligible for a degree with honors). A “course” is equivalent to 4 credits,\\nand a course is normally the length of a term. (A “course” is equivalent to the “half-course”\\ndesignation in earlier Handbooks.) The only non-letter grade that counts toward the requirement\\nof 84 satisfactory letter-graded credits is Satisfactory (SAT); only one (8-credit) senior tutorial\\ncourse graded Satisfactory may be so counted.\\n\\nForty-eight of the required 84 letter-graded credits should be completed by the end of\\nsophomore year. Ordinarily, no first-year student or sophomore may take fewer than three\\nletter-graded courses (4 credits per course) in any term. First-year students who wish to\\ncomplete fewer than 16 credits per term must obtain the approval of their Resident Dean.\\n\\nStudents studying abroad for one term (fall or spring) must pass 112 credits at Harvard and\\nreceive letter grades of C- or higher in at least 72 of them (84 to be eligible for a degree with\\nhonors). Students studying abroad for two terms (fall and spring), and sophomore transfer\\nstudents (32 credits granted) must pass 96 credits at Harvard and receive letter grades of C- or\\nhigher in at least 60 of them (at least 72 to be eligible for a degree with honors). Junior transfer\\nstudents (64 credits granted) must pass 64 credits at Harvard and receive letter grades of C- or\\nhigher in at least 40 of them (at least 48 to be eligible for a degree with honors).

Students will not ordinarily be recommended for the A.B. or S.B. degree\\nwithout having completed eight terms of residence.\\n\\nExceptions to the residency requirements are made for students who graduate in fewer than\\neight terms or who matriculated with transfer credit. Some students may complete Harvard\\ndegree requirements in fewer than eight terms as a result of course work done elsewhere that is\\napproved in advance and counted by Harvard toward degree requirements (see “Requirements\\nfor the Degree”), or as a result of course work done at the Harvard Summer School (see\\n“Harvard Summer School”), or as a result of having worked at a rate of more than 16 credits per\\nterm. No student will be recommended for the A.B. or the S.B. degree who has not completed a\\nminimum of four regular terms in the College as a candidate for that degree and passed at least\\n64 credits during regular terms in Harvard College.\\nStudents who have not completed the degree requirements within the allotted number of terms\\n(“lost degree” candidates) may complete degree requirements only by enrolling in the Harvard\\nSummer School, by successfully petitioning the Administrative Board for an additional term (see\\n“Additional Term”), or, if eligible, by enrolling in an approved study abroad program (see “Study\\nAbroad”).\\n\\nConcentration Requirement\\n\\nAll degree candidates must fulfill the requirements of one of the recognized fields of\\nconcentration, an approved joint concentration, or an approved special concentration.\\nOverviews of each concentration, its specific requirements, and how to obtain more information\\nabout the concentration are included in Fields of Concentration,\\nhttps://handbook.college.harvard.edu/#fields.\\n\\nIn many concentrations, students may pursue either a basic program or one that makes them\\neligible for honors in the field. Honors-eligible programs generally differ from basic programs in\\nthat they require a senior thesis and/or advanced course work. To be awarded the degree with\\nhonors in the field of concentration, the student must complete the honors requirements within\\nthe concentration, receive an honors recommendation from the department or committee that\\nsupervises the concentration, and meet the College-wide requirements for an honors degree.\\nStudents should understand that completing the degree requirements for an honors-eligible\\nprogram does not guarantee that they will graduate with honors (see \"Requirements for Honors\\nDegrees”).\\n\\nDECLARING A CONCENTRATION\\nStudents should plan their concentration program with a representative of the concentration who\\nwill approve the Declaration of Concentration and the Plan of Study. This procedure constitutes\\nofficial admission to the field of concentration. Students ordinarily must fulfill concentration\\nrequirements as they were defined in the Fields of Concentration and Secondary Fields\\nrequirements the year the Plan of Study was approved, although in those situations in which a\\nconcentration subsequently changes its requirements, the Head Tutor or Director of\\nUndergraduate Studies may allow students to substitute the new requirements.\\n\\nEvery student is required to have a documented advising conversation with a representative\\nfrom one or more prospective concentrations near the end of the second term of enrollment.\\nThese advising conversations do not indicate any binding decision on the part of the student.'),\n",

Students who are out of sequence because of\\nleaves or withdrawals must declare a concentration no later than two weeks before the end of\\nclasses of their third term of enrollment.\\n\\nJOINT CONCENTRATIONS\\nA joint concentration combines two fields that are each an undergraduate concentration and\\nintegrates them into a coherent field of study, culminating in an interdisciplinary thesis written\\nwhile enrolled in the thesis tutorial of one concentration only.\\nSome concentrations do not participate in joint concentration programs, so students should\\nconsult with the Head Tutor or Director of Undergraduate Study in the relevant fields for more\\ninformation. One of the concentrations is designated the primary concentration. For students to\\nreceive approval for a joint concentration, both of the participating concentrations must be\\nsatisfied with the coherence and merit of the student’s plan and be prepared to supervise the\\nprogram in detail.\\n\\nFor students who do not wish to integrate the work of two separate fields into one coherent\\nprogram, but still wish to pursue a second disciplinary area, a double concentration or\\nsecondary field may be appropriate (see Fields of Concentration,\\nhttps://handbook.college.harvard.edu/#fields).\\n\\nDOUBLE CONCENTRATIONS\\nThe double concentration facilitates in-depth, structured coursework in two separate\\nconcentrations. The coursework in these two fields may not substantially overlap with each\\nother. A limit of 8 credits (generally 2 courses) may be double counted between the two\\nconcentrations. Students may apply to write theses in both concentrations but may receive\\nhonors in only one concentration, which must be designated as the honors field. Departmental\\nhonors are determined solely by the designated honors field. Students may choose to pursue a\\ndouble concentration or a joint concentration, but not both.\\nDeclaration of the double concentration does not require approval from both concentrations.\\nEach concentration will review and approve declaration separately. Students must declare at\\nleast one concentration in the fall term of their second year (see the Harvard College Academic\\nCalendar, https://registrar.fas.harvard.edu/harvard-college-academic-calendar, for specific\\ndeadlines). Students who are out of sequence because of leaves or withdrawals must declare a\\nconcentration no later than two weeks before the end of classes of their third term of enrollment.\\nStudents may declare a double concentration at that time, declaring their honors field by the end\\nof the spring term of their second year before the deadline for fall term registration, leaving time\\nto benefit from advising in both concentrations. Students pursuing the Bachelor of Science\\n(S.B.) degree may not pursue a double concentration.\\n\\nCHANGING CONCENTRATIONS\\nA change of field on the student record and transcript is not complete until the petition has been\\napproved by the department and the change is reflected on my.harvard.\\n\\nAfter the deadline for degree applications in a student’s final term in the College, a change of'),\n",

Except for those tutorial courses graded SAT/UNS (see “Non-Letter Grades”),\\nletter grades ordinarily are reported for tutorials given for credit. A field of concentration may\\nbar any student from the tutorial program because of unsatisfactory work.\\n\\nOrdinarily, the work in a senior tutorial centers on writing a thesis. A student who does not\\ncomplete the thesis but nevertheless wishes to receive credit for the tutorial course may be\\nrequired by the concentration to submit a paper or other substantial piece of work before any\\ncredit can be awarded.\\n\\nGENERAL EXAMINATIONS\\nSome concentrations require that students pass a general examination before being\\nrecommended for the degree or being recommended for the degree with honors in the field.\\nNo student concentrating in a field where general examinations are required is eligible for the\\ndegree, whatever the student’s record in courses may be, until the student has passed this\\nexamination to the satisfaction of the concentration.\\n\\nStudents in concentrations with general examinations should consult with the concentration’s\\ntutorial office about scheduling these examinations.

This\\nplan must be endorsed by the student’s Head Tutor or Director of Undergraduate Studies, and\\nthen the student may petition the Administrative Board by the appropriate deadline for the term\\nin which the student wishes to include courses elsewhere in their plans of study.\\n\\nHarvard College students who are enrolled in Harvard’s double degree (A.B./M.M.) program\\nwith New England Conservatory or joint studies program with Berklee College of Music may\\npetition the Administrative Board by the appropriate deadline in order to be allowed to take up to\\ntwo courses in a given term at New England Conservatory or Berklee College of Music. Double\\ndegree and joint studies students must demonstrate that the course will contribute to a\\ncompelling academic plan tied to their work in the double degree program and that the course is\\nnot offered at Harvard. The student’s plan must be endorsed by the advisor to the double\\ndegree program in Harvard’s Department of Music. It is each student’s responsibility to gain\\nadmission to and pay for instruction at the other institution and to present a transcript from the\\nother institution for the work completed at the end of the term, following the usual procedures for\\nstudy out of residence. Harvard tuition is reduced for these students on a per-course basis for\\neach course taken elsewhere for Harvard degree credit, and those students eligible for financial\\naid may apply their aid to the costs of studying at the other institution. Provided that their\\ncombined program at Harvard and the other institution adds up to a full load, students may\\ncontinue in College housing subject to the ordinary eligibility rules. All other administrative\\nprocedures and limitations on the overall amount of credit a student may earn out of residence\\nfollow the policies for full-time study out of residence (see “Earning Degree Credit for Study\\nAbroad” and https://oie.fas.harvard.edu/credit-guidelines).

In addition to submitting an\\nonline petition, first-year students are also required to send a statement of interest by email to\\ntheir Resident Dean. The statement should explain why the student wants to cross-register, how\\nthe course fits into the student’s curricular plans, and why no other courses within the FAS will\\nmeet those needs.\\n\\nIn order to cross-register, a student’s immediately previous academic record ordinarily must be\\nsatisfactory. Exceptions must be approved by the Resident Dean.

Courses taken through cross-registration will not meet the College’s Divisional\\ndistribution requirement. Students participating in cross-registration must enroll in at least one,\\n4-credit FAS course each term (see “Rate of Work”).\\n\\nAll undergraduate regulations, including those regarding the deadlines for dropping and\\nwithdrawing, makeups, and extensions of time apply to cross-registration courses, even though\\nother schools may use a different calendar. These regulations also apply to undergraduates\\ncross-registered in courses that may be applicable to graduate degree requirements. Harvard\\nCollege students are expected to follow the deadlines and procedures of both the College and\\nthe other school or university. When two deadlines conflict, the earlier one applies.\\n\\nStudents must complete all course work by the last day of FAS examinations unless they\\nreceive approval from the Administrative Board for an extension of time (see “Extensions of\\nTime for Written or Laboratory Work”). Students must bring examination conflicts caused by\\ncross-registration to the attention of the appropriate registrars as soon as possible. Students\\nrequesting a makeup examination in a cross-registration course must report this request to their\\nResident Dean, as usual, and must also petition the Registrar of the school offering the course\\nto arrange the makeup, which, if approved, will be given under the rules of that School.\\n\\nTo meet graduation deadlines, second-term seniors should notify the instructor that grades for\\ndegree candidates must be received by the FAS Registrar’s Office at least 10 days prior to\\nCommencement. Harvard College students cannot graduate if grades are missing.\\n\\nStudents may not cross-register into January term courses nor may they receive credit for\\nJanuary term courses.\\n\\nGRADING\\nGrading evaluation and notation for cross-registered courses will adhere to the standards of the\\nschool offering the course and will be recorded on the student transcript. These grading\\nconventions may not be altered. Because “Incomplete” cannot be accepted as a grade for an\\nundergraduate, such grades will be converted to “No Credit” (a failing grade) unless an\\nextension of time is voted by the Administrative Board. Students may take cross-registered\\ncourses for a letter grade or pass/fail unless a specific grading option is required for the course.\\n\\nPassing grades received for courses taken through cross-registration will not be used in\\ncomputing a student’s College GPA. Courses taken by cross-registration will normally be\\nequated to FAS courses for the purpose of calculating rate of work (see “Rate of Work”) but will\\nnot be counted toward the letter-graded credit requirement or any honors degree requirements.\\nA failing grade or the equivalent earned in a cross-registered course will be included in honors\\ndegree calculations and GPA. Harvard will not count toward the undergraduate degree any\\ncourses that have been credited toward other degrees already conferred.\\n\\nROTC\\nStudents may earn up to 8 Harvard credits through ROTC at MIT toward the Harvard degree.\\nThese courses will count toward the overall credits required to graduate, but they will not factor\\ninto the student’s GPA or satisfy concentration requirements.

There are two types of honors in the College: English\\nhonors (or departmental honors) are determined by the department, committee, School, or\\nprogram that oversees the relevant concentration and are based solely on work done in the\\nconcentration; Latin honors (or College honors) are based on the entirety of the student record,\\nand recommendations for Latin honors are made to the Governing Boards of the University by\\nthe FAS.\\n\\nThe FAS recommends bachelor’s degrees for presentation to the Governing Boards of the\\nUniversity as follows: regular degree; cum laude on the basis of the student’s overall record;\\ncum laude in a field; magna cum laude in a field; magna cum laude with highest honors in a\\nfield; or summa cum laude in a field. Faculty and concentration standards for honors may\\nchange without notice; both sets of standards must be met.\\n\\nAll candidates for degrees with honors must have satisfactory letter grades (C– or higher) in a\\nminimum of 96 letter-graded credits (prorated appropriately for students graduating with fewer\\nthan 128 credits passed at Harvard). Grade point averages are based on all completed letter-\\ngraded courses taken while at Harvard including all failed courses, courses taken for credit in\\nHarvard Summer School, and by cross-registration only as appropriate (see “Grade Point\\nAverages for Undergraduates”).\\n\\nThe relevant concentration will determine the level of English honors, if any, for an\\nundergraduate who completes the requirements for honors eligibility in that field. If departmental\\nhonors are awarded, the student may then be recommended to the College for a determination\\nof Latin honors. Thus, the awarding of departmental honors for work in a concentration is a\\nprecondition for the recommendation by the College of Latin honors in a field. It is possible that\\na student who has completed the relevant requirements for honors in a concentration will have\\nthe student’s record judged unworthy of honors in the field but still worthy of a degree; such a\\nstudent may then be recommended by the FAS for a regular degree, subject to the general\\nregulations, or, if qualified, for the degree cum laude. When applicable, both English honors and\\nLatin honors are noted on the official transcript. Only Latin honors are designated on the\\ndiploma.\\n\\nThe Faculty will award degrees with honors based on the criteria below:'),\n",

Students who fail to meet the minimum requirements ordinarily will be required to\\nwithdraw for two terms, whether or not their previous record was unsatisfactory.

However, for first-year\\nstudents in their first term, an academic record will be considered satisfactory if all grades are\\npassing, at most one grade is unsatisfactory, and at least one grade is a satisfactory letter\\ngrade. A student whose record is unsatisfactory is ordinarily placed on probation.

The warning\\nshould specify the steps the student must take in order to be allowed to continue in the course.\\nA student may also be excluded from a course by the Honor Council if the student has\\ncommitted academic dishonesty in the course. Exclusion from a course is equivalent in all\\nrespects to failing it, and in and of itself exclusion makes the student’s record for the term\\nunsatisfactory. A notation of EXL (Excluded) on the transcript indicates that the student was not\\npermitted to continue in the course and received no credit.

Students are expected to be familiar with the regulations that apply to\\nthem as covered in this Handbook. The rules of Harvard College provide a framework within\\nwhich all students are free to pursue their work, under the safest and most equitable conditions\\nthe College can create. These rules, then, serve as the guidelines forming the protection of\\neach individual’s well-being. Whenever violations of the rules occur, the College will treat them\\nas matters of serious concern because they disrupt the individual lives of students and the\\nshared life of this community.\\n\\nIt is the expectation of the College that all students, whether or not they are on campus or are\\ncurrently enrolled as degree candidates, will behave in a mature and responsible manner. This\\nexpectation for mature and responsible conduct also encompasses accountability for one’s own\\nwell-being, including responsible decision-making regarding physical and mental health.\\nFurther, the College expects every student to be familiar with the regulations governing\\nmembership in the Harvard community, set forth in the pages that follow. Because students are\\nexpected to show good judgment and use common sense at all times, not all kinds of\\nmisconduct or behavioral standards are codified here. The College takes all these diverse\\nprinciples very seriously; together they create a foundation for the responsible, respectful\\nsociety that Harvard seeks to foster among its students, faculty, and staff.\\n\\nStudents are expected to comply with all disciplinary rules from matriculation until the conferring\\nof the degree. A degree will not be granted to a student who is not in good standing or for whom\\nthere is an unresolved alleged disciplinary violation with the Administrative Board, Honor\\nCouncil, or disciplinary board of another professional school at Harvard.\\n\\nCareful note should be taken that the University is not, and cannot be considered as, a protector\\nor sanctuary from the existing laws of the city, state, or federal government.\\n\\nNon-Discrimination and Anti-Bullying\\nThe University has adopted policies and procedures to address discrimination and bullying.\\nThese policies apply to all students, faculty, staff, researchers and other members of the\\nHarvard community across all Schools and units, including Harvard College. The University’s\\nnon-discrimination and anti-bullying policies can be found on the Office of the Provost’s website\\nhere: https://provost.harvard.edu/files/provost/files/non-discrimination_and_anti-\\nbullying_policies.pdf.\\n\\nWhenever a formal complaint of discrimination or bullying is investigated in accordance with the\\nUniversity’s non-discrimination and anti-bullying policies and procedures, and those procedures\\nresult in a finding that a policy violation has occurred, then sanctions or remedial measures will\\nbe determined by the College’s Appropriate Official or designee(s), as set forth in those\\nprocedures. The College’s Appropriate Official or designee(s) must accept the finding of a policy\\nviolation as final and non-reviewable. The only opportunity to appeal the determination of a\\npolicy violation is provided within the University’s Non-Discrimination and Anti-Bullying policies\\nand procedures. Decisions about sanctions and remedial measures are final and cannot be\\nappealed.\\nLocal Designated Resources (LDRs) in the College serve as a resource for receiving reports\\nand complaints, directing community members to resources, and providing information on\\nsupportive measures.'),\n",

By accepting membership in the University, an individual joins a community ideally\\ncharacterized by free expression, free inquiry, intellectual honesty, respect for the dignity of\\nothers, and openness to constructive change. The rights and responsibilities exercised within\\nthe community must be compatible with these qualities.\\n\\nThe rights of members of the University are not fundamentally different from those of other\\nmembers of society. The University, however, has a special autonomy and reasoned dissent\\nplays a particularly vital part in its existence. All members of the University have the right to\\npress for action on matters of concern by any appropriate means. The University must affirm,\\nassure and protect the rights of its members to organize and join political associations, convene\\nand conduct public meetings, publicly demonstrate and picket in orderly fashion, advocate, and\\npublicize opinion by print, sign, and voice.\\n\\nThe University places special emphasis, as well, upon certain values which are essential to its\\nnature as an academic community. Among these are freedom of speech and academic\\nfreedom, freedom from personal force and violence, and freedom of movement. Interference'),\n",

Furthermore, although the administrative processes and\\nactivities of the University cannot be ends in themselves, such functions are vital to the orderly\\npursuit of the work of all members of the University. Therefore, interference with members of the\\nUniversity in performance of their normal duties and activities must be regarded as\\nunacceptable obstruction of the essential processes of the University. Theft or willful destruction\\nof the property of the University or of its members must also be considered an unacceptable\\nviolation of the rights of individuals or of the community as a whole.\\n\\nMoreover, it is the responsibility of all members of the academic community to maintain an\\natmosphere in which violations of rights are unlikely to occur and to develop processes by which\\nthese rights are fully assured. In particular, it is the responsibility of officers of administration and\\ninstruction to be alert to the needs of the University community; to give full and fair hearing to\\nreasoned expressions of grievances; and to respond promptly and in good faith to such\\nexpressions and to widely expressed needs for change. In making decisions which concern the\\ncommunity as a whole or any part of the community, officers are expected to consult with those\\naffected by the decisions. Failures to meet these responsibilities may be profoundly damaging\\nto the life of the University. Therefore, the University community has the right to establish\\norderly procedures consistent with imperatives of academic freedom to assess the policies and\\nassure the responsibility of those whose decisions affect the life of the University.\\n\\nNo violation of the rights of members of the University, nor any failure to meet responsibilities,\\nshould be interpreted as justifying any violation of the rights of members of the University.

The unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol by students and\\nemployees on Harvard property or as a part of any Harvard activity are violations of University\\nrules as well as the law. Possession, use, or distribution of certain nonprescription drugs,\\nincluding cannabis, amphetamines, heroin, cocaine, and nonprescription synthetics;\\nprocurement or distribution of alcohol by anyone under 21 years of age; and provision of alcohol\\nto anyone under 21 years of age are violations of the law and of Harvard policy.\\n\\nAlthough Massachusetts law now permits adults aged 21 or older to possess and consume\\ncannabis under certain circumstances, federal law prohibits the possession, use, or distribution\\nof cannabis, including for medical purposes, on Harvard property or as part of a Harvard\\nactivity.

There are heavy penalties, including imprisonment, for possession or distribution of illicit\\ndrugs and for selling or delivering alcohol to, or procuring alcohol for, anyone under 21.\\n6. The consumption of alcohol on public property or on property open to the public is\\nprohibited.\\n\\nAll students are expected to comply with all applicable city, state, and federal laws and\\nregulations as well as with all College rules governing the use and possession of alcohol.\\nThe College does not permit transportation or consumption of alcoholic beverages in open\\ncontainers in public areas on campus.\\n\\nDISCIPLINARY ACTION\\nThe University requires all students to become familiar with the information on drugs and\\nalcohol distributed at registration each year and expects students to make responsible choices\\nand create safe social environments. The College will take serious action, ordinarily probation or\\nrequirement to withdraw, in any case involving the possession in quantity or the sale or\\ndistribution of drugs, or when cases of drug and alcohol use create a danger to individuals or to\\nthe community at large.

If the event hosts\\nare not identified, then the officers of the organization may be held personally responsible. In\\nconsidering such cases, the College will, in all circumstances, apply the Help-Seeking Policy as\\ndescribed below.\\n\\nAt a minimum, when cases involving the consumption of alcohol or drugs at an event held,\\nsponsored, organized, or supported by a student group come to the attention of the College, the\\nstudent group may be asked to come to the Dean of Students Office for a conversation about\\ntheir procedures for hosting responsible social events and may be asked to participate in\\nadditional education or training efforts.\\n\\nAPPLICATION OF THE HELP-SEEKING POLICY TO STUDENT GROUPS\\nThe Help-Seeking Policy is intended to encourage all members of student groups to access\\nhelp for the effects of drug or alcohol use. If a person needs assistance after consuming alcohol\\nor drugs at an event held, sponsored, organized, or supported by a student group and the\\nperson who seeks assistance is a member of that student group, then the College will weigh this\\nfact heavily as a mitigating circumstance when considering potential disciplinary action with\\nrespect to other student group members. Conversely, the failure to seek help by members of the\\nstudent group also may be considered in deciding whether to impose disciplinary action. In\\naddition, the College may consider as mitigating factors the student group’s participation in the\\nCollege’s annual education and training about responsible social events, as well as any efforts\\nmade by the hosts or officers to prevent the harmful or potentially harmful situation and their\\ncooperation with the College in its investigation of the situation.\\n\\nUSUAL RESPONSES\\nAs described above, officers of the College initially may respond to the use of illicit drugs,\\nunderage possession or consumption of alcohol, serving alcohol to underage individuals, or\\noverconsumption of alcohol with a warning and/or referral to the Center for Wellness and Health\\nPromotion.

Use of Harvard’s computers and networks for business-related purposes without\\nauthorization is also prohibited. (See “Student Business Activity”).\\n\\nPrivacy of Information\\nInformation stored on a computer system or sent electronically over a network is the property of\\nthe individual who created it. Examination, collection, or dissemination of that information\\nwithout authorization from the owner is a violation of the owner’s rights to control their own\\nproperty. Information technology personnel, however, may gain access to users’ data or\\nprograms when it is necessary to maintain or prevent damage to systems or to ensure\\ncompliance with other University rules.\\n\\nComputer systems and networks provide mechanisms for the protection of private information\\nfrom examination. These mechanisms are necessarily imperfect, and any attempt to circumvent\\nthem or to gain unauthorized access to private information (including both stored computer files\\nand messages transmitted over a network) will be treated as a violation of privacy and will be\\ncause for disciplinary action.\\n\\nIn general, information that the owner would reasonably regard as private must be treated as\\nprivate by other users. Examples include the contents of electronic mailboxes, the private file\\nstorage areas of individual users, and information stored in other areas that are not public. That\\nmeasures have not been taken to protect such information does not make it permissible for\\nothers to inspect it.\\n\\nOn shared and networked computer systems certain information about users and their activities\\nis visible to others. Users are cautioned that certain accounting and directory information (for\\nexample, usernames and electronic mail addresses), certain records of file names and executed\\ncommands, and information stored in public areas are not private. Nonetheless, such unsecured\\ninformation about other users must not be manipulated in ways that they might reasonably find\\nintrusive; for example, eavesdropping by computer and systematic monitoring of the behavior of\\nothers are likely to be considered invasions of privacy that would be cause for disciplinary\\naction. The compilation or redistribution of information from University directories (printed or\\nelectronic) is forbidden.\\n\\nHARVARD UNIVERSITY POLICY ON ACCESS TO ELECTRONIC INFORMATION\\nEffective March 31, 2014, Harvard established a policy that sets out guidelines and processes\\nfor University access to user electronic information stored in or transmitted through any\\nUniversity system.

Students may refer to the website\\nfor the Administrative Board (https://adboard.fas.harvard.edu/) for more information on the\\nnumber of petitions and cases, category by category, considered by the Administrative\\nBoard in the previous five years.

Appeals involving\\ncases of sexual or gender-based harassment are described in the University Procedures as well\\nas in the FAS Procedures.\\n\\nACTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD\\nIt should be noted that students are considered in good standing when they are not on probation\\nand/or have not been required to withdraw, dismissed, or expelled from the College for either\\nacademic or disciplinary reasons. Warnings and admonitions do not affect a student’s good\\nstanding.\\n\\nIn disciplinary cases, if the Administrative Board determines that wrongdoing occurred, it may\\ntake the following actions:\\n\\n1. Requirement to Complete an Educational Program: A requirement to successfully\\ncomplete an educational program. This requirement may also be appended to any of the\\nother actions listed below.\\n\\n2. Warn or Admonish: A reprimand to a student whose behavior violates the rules or\\nstandards of conduct of the community. A warning becomes part of the student’s official\\nrecord, but is not considered a formal disciplinary action.\\n\\n3. Disciplinary Probation: A strong warning to a student whose conduct gives serious cause\\nfor concern. Probation is a formal disciplinary action of the College and becomes part of\\nthe student’s official record.\\n\\nDuring the period of time (to be specified by the Administrative Board) that a student is\\non probation, any further instance of misconduct will cause the Administrative Board to\\nseriously consider requiring the student to withdraw from the College. Students on\\nprobation must be especially conscientious about their behavior and responsibilities. If\\nthe offense is related to participation in extracurricular activity, the Administrative Board\\nmay at its discretion restrict such participation; in cases in which management of time\\nappears to contribute to the problem, the Administrative Board may require that the\\nstudent obtain the Administrative Board’s permission for participation in each individual\\nactivity. The Administrative Board may also attach additional requirements to probation.\\nA student’s failure to amend their conduct so as to meet the standards of this community\\nis a grave matter, ordinarily leading to further disciplinary action, including requirement to\\nwithdraw. Students placed on disciplinary probation are ordinarily relieved of probation at\\nthe end of a set period of time (specified by the Administrative Board in its decision) if\\nthey have maintained satisfactory conduct. Students on probation may not receive a\\ndegree until they have been relieved of probation by the Administrative Board.\\n\\n4. Requirement to Withdraw for Disciplinary Reasons: Action taken in serious disciplinary\\ncases indicating that the student’s behavior is unacceptable in this community.\\nRequirement to withdraw is a formal disciplinary action of the College and becomes part\\nof the student’s official record.

Students who are required to withdraw from the University are not entitled to\\nan identification card until they have been officially readmitted (see also “Harvard\\nUniversity Identification Cards”).\\n\\nA student who is required to withdraw for disciplinary reasons is not in good standing\\nuntil readmitted, and may not participate in any academic exercises or extracurricular\\nactivities. Students may not receive a degree until they have been readmitted to good\\nstanding in the College. In order to be readmitted, the student ordinarily must have been\\naway from the College for at least one but ordinarily two or more full terms and must\\nhave shown an acceptable record of performance during a substantial period (at least\\nsix consecutive months) of regular employment. Employment must be full time, paid,\\nsupervised, and evaluated, and not in a business owned or controlled by the student’s\\nfamily. Without exception, students who have been required to withdraw must petition\\nthe Administrative Board to be readmitted to the College, and the Administrative Board’s\\ndecision will depend on its judgment of the student’s readiness to rejoin the College\\ncommunity (see also “Readmission after Requirement to Withdraw for Disciplinary or\\nAcademic Reasons”). A student who has twice been required to withdraw from the\\nCollege will ordinarily not be readmitted. No student who for disciplinary reasons\\nhas been required to withdraw for the second and final time or dismissed from\\nHarvard College may ordinarily enroll in the Harvard Summer School or in the\\nExtension School.\\n5. Dismissal: Action taken in serious disciplinary cases whereby a student’s connection\\nwith the University is ended by vote of the Faculty Council. (The action taken by the\\nAdministrative Board is a vote of requirement to withdraw with a recommendation to the\\nFaculty Council that the student be dismissed.) Dismissal does not necessarily preclude\\na student’s return, but readmission is granted rarely and only by vote of the Faculty\\nCouncil. A dismissed student is not in good standing until readmitted.\\n\\n6. Expulsion: The most extreme disciplinary action possible. It signifies that the student is\\nno longer welcome in the community. Expulsion must be voted by the Faculty Council.\\n(The action taken by the Administrative Board is a vote of requirement to withdraw with a\\nrecommendation to the Faculty Council that the student be expelled.) A student who is\\nexpelled can never be readmitted and restored to good standing.\\n\\nIn cases of academic review the Administrative Board can take any of the following actions:\\n\\n1. Academic Probation: a serious warning to a student whose academic performance for\\nthe term is unsatisfactory. Academic probation is a formal action taken by the Registrar\\non behalf of the Administrative Board and becomes part of the student’s official record.\\n\\nDuring the time that a student is on academic probation, any further instance of\\nunsatisfactory academic progress will cause the Administrative Board to give serious\\nconsideration to requiring the student to withdraw from the College, ordinarily for two\\nterms. A student on probation must attend all classes and be especially conscientious\\nabout all academic responsibilities. If the unsatisfactory academic record is related to\\nparticipation in extracurricular activity, the Administrative Board may at its discretion\\nrestrict participation; in cases in which management of time appears to be the problem,\\nthe Administrative Board may require the student to obtain the Administrative Board’s'),\n",

Requirement to Withdraw for Academic Reasons: formal action of the College that\\nbecomes part of the student’s official record and that may be taken in the following\\ncircumstances reflecting the Administrative Board’s judgment that the record indicates\\nthat the student should be given time to reassess academic goals and plans:\\n\\n§ In the case of a student who has failed to have a satisfactory record for two\\nconsecutive terms.\\n§ At any return of grades in the case of any student, whether or not previously on\\nprobation, whose record fails to meet the minimum requirements (see “Minimum\\nRequirements”).\\n§ In the case of serious neglect of work followed by an unsatisfactory record in any\\nterm, even though the student has met the minimum requirements.\\n\\nStudents who have been required to withdraw for academic reasons should consult\\nclosely with their Resident Dean regarding financial aid and financial obligations\\n(tuition, housing fees, food, etc.), which vary in certain respects from the obligations for\\nundergraduates who go on leave of absence or who are required to withdraw for\\ndisciplinary reasons.

Resident Deans and those acting on their behalf will answer honestly and fully all\\nquestions asked of them on admissions and fellowship applications.\\n2. Resident Deans and those acting on their behalf will advise students of their\\nresponsibility to answer honestly and fully all questions asked on admissions and\\nfellowship applications.\\n3. Any requirement to withdraw for academic reasons must always be mentioned in all\\nrecommendations for students provided on behalf of Harvard College.\\n4. Any requirement to withdraw or probation for disciplinary reasons must always be\\nmentioned in all recommendations for students provided on behalf of Harvard College.\\n5. Resident Deans and those acting on their behalf will amend any letters of\\nrecommendation provided on behalf of Harvard College to reflect any change in a\\nstudent’s status.\\n6. Every recommendation mentioning one or more actions taken for disciplinary or\\nacademic reasons will state that doing so is mandated by College policy. The letters will\\nplace such actions in the context of the student’s overall undergraduate experience at\\nHarvard.\\n7. If a disciplinary matter is pending at the time a letter of recommendation is prepared, the\\nletter will state that a disciplinary matter is pending, and that this is being reported as a\\nmatter of College policy.\\n\\nREADMISSION AFTER REQUIREMENT TO WITHDRAW FOR DISCIPLINARY\\nOR ACADEMIC REASONS\\nStudents who have been required to withdraw will be readmitted only if they can present\\nconvincing evidence that they are likely to achieve good standing with respect to both their\\nacademic record and conduct if given a second opportunity to study at Harvard. In all such\\ncases the student must petition the Administrative Board to be readmitted to the College, and\\nthe Administrative Board’s decision will depend on its judgment of the student’s readiness to\\nresume studies and to rejoin the College community.\\n\\nReadmission is not automatic. Students must fulfill the Faculty’s and the Administrative Board’s\\nminimum requirements for readmission listed below. They must also meet any special\\nrequirements set by the Administrative Board or Honor Council and described in the letter sent\\nthem by the Resident Dean when they were required to withdraw. Examples of such additional,\\nspecial requirements are a specified level of achievement in a session of the Harvard Summer\\nSchool, and more than two terms spent away from the College and the Harvard campus.

Earlier deadlines for housing and financial aid applications will\\npertain even though petitions for readmission cannot be considered before December or\\nMay.\\n\\nMinimum general prerequisites for readmission are:\\n\\n1.

These\\ninclude, for example, potential plagiarism, inappropriate collaboration, exam cheating, copying,\\nand other violations.

All meetings and discussions of the Honor Council are confidential. It is the policy of the\\nFaculty that while evaluation of academic work is entirely in the hands of the instructor,\\nquestions of academic honesty are adjudicated by the Honor Council. Students have a right to\\nexpect that grading will not be used as punishment for alleged academic dishonesty that has not\\nbeen confirmed by the Honor Council. Students may ask the Honor Council, through their\\nResident Dean, to investigate and resolve informal allegations of academic dishonesty that have\\nnot been brought to the Council’s attention by a faculty member.\\n\\nThe Honor Council is made up of an equal number of Harvard College undergraduates and FAS\\nFaculty members, administrators, and GSAS teaching fellows. Members are selected to\\nrepresent the academic community as broadly as possible. The Honor Council publishes its\\nprocedures to provide members of the Harvard College community with a guide to its work.\\nThose procedures are presented on the Honor Council’s website\\n(https://honorcouncil.fas.harvard.edu/).\\n\\nStudents may request that their case be reconsidered provided that new materially relevant\\ninformation becomes available or there is reasonable evidence of a procedural error.

Requirement to Complete an Educational Program: A requirement to successfully\\ncomplete an educational program. This requirement may also be appended to any of the\\nother actions listed below.\\n\\n2. Warn or Admonish: A reprimand to a student whose behavior violates the rules or\\nstandards of conduct of the community. A warning becomes part of the student’s official\\nrecord, but is not considered a formal disciplinary action.\\n\\n3. Exclusion from a Course: A notation of EXL on the transcript, indicating that the student\\nwas not permitted to continue in the course and received no credit. Exclusion from a\\ncourse is equivalent in all respects to failing it and in and of itself makes the student’s\\nrecord for the term unsatisfactory.\\n\\n4. Referral for Local Sanctions: A referral to the faculty member teaching the course in\\nwhich the finding of academic dishonesty was made with a recommendation that “local\\nsanctions” (for example: mandatory tutoring, a course warning, an ungraded rework of\\nthe assignment in question, a grade penalty, or a failure for the assignment) are\\nappropriate. Such sanctions will be imposed at the discretion of the faculty member in\\nconsultation with the Honor Council.\\n\\n5. Disciplinary Probation: A strong warning to a student whose conduct gives serious cause\\nfor concern. Probation is a formal disciplinary action of the College and becomes part of\\nthe student’s official record.\\n\\nDuring the period of time (to be specified by the Honor Council) that a student is on\\nprobation, any further instance of misconduct will cause the Honor Council to seriously\\nconsider requiring the student to withdraw from the College. Students on probation must\\nbe especially conscientious about their behavior and responsibilities. If the offense is\\nrelated to participation in extracurricular activity, the Honor Council may at its discretion\\nrestrict such participation; in cases in which management of time appears to contribute\\nto the problem, the Honor Council may require that the student obtain the Honor\\nCouncil’s permission for participation in each individual activity. The Honor Council may\\nalso attach additional requirements to probation. A student’s failure to amend their\\nconduct so as to meet the standards of this community is a grave matter, ordinarily\\nleading to further disciplinary action, including requirement to withdraw. Students placed\\non disciplinary probation are ordinarily relieved of probation at the end of a set period of\\ntime (specified by the Honor Council in its decision) if they have maintained satisfactory\\nconduct. Students on probation may not receive a degree until they have been relieved\\nof probation by the Honor Council.\\n\\n6. Requirement to Withdraw for Disciplinary Reasons: Action taken in serious disciplinary\\ncases indicating that the student’s behavior is unacceptable in this community.\\nRequirement to withdraw is a formal disciplinary action of the College and becomes part\\nof the student’s official record. Requirement to withdraw ordinarily is effective\\nimmediately upon vote of the Honor Council. However, the Council may consider\\nmitigating circumstances and delay the effective date of the requirement to withdraw. For\\nexample, the Honor Council may decide to allow the student to complete the current\\nterm’s coursework and begin their separation at the end of the term.'),\n",

Students who are required to withdraw from the University are not entitled to\\nan identification card until they have been officially readmitted (see also “Harvard\\nUniversity Identification Cards”).\\n\\nA student who is required to withdraw for disciplinary reasons is not in good standing\\nuntil readmitted and may not participate in any academic exercises or extracurricular\\nactivities. Students may not receive a degree until they have been readmitted to good\\nstanding in the College. In order to be readmitted, the student ordinarily must have been\\naway from the College for at least one but ordinarily two or more full terms and must\\nhave shown an acceptable record of performance during a substantial period (at least\\nsix consecutive months) of regular employment. Employment must be full time, paid,\\nsupervised, and evaluated, and not in a business owned or controlled by the student’s\\nfamily. Without exception, students who have been required to withdraw must petition\\nthe Administrative Board to be readmitted to the College, and the Administrative Board’s\\ndecision will depend on its judgment of the student’s readiness to rejoin the College\\ncommunity (see also “Readmission after Requirement to Withdraw for Disciplinary or\\nAcademic Reasons”). A student who has twice been required to withdraw from the\\nCollege will ordinarily not be readmitted. No student who for disciplinary reasons\\nhas been required to withdraw for the second and final time or dismissed from\\nHarvard College may ordinarily enroll in the Harvard Summer School or in the\\nExtension School.\\n7. Dismissal: Action taken in serious disciplinary cases whereby a student’s connection\\nwith the University is ended by vote of the Faculty Council. (The action taken by the\\nHonor Council is a vote of requirement to withdraw with a recommendation to the\\nFaculty Council that the student be dismissed.) Dismissal does not necessarily preclude\\na student’s return, but readmission is granted rarely and only by vote of the Faculty\\nCouncil. A dismissed student is not in good standing until readmitted.\\n\\n8. Expulsion: The most extreme disciplinary action possible. It signifies that the student is\\nno longer welcome in the community. Expulsion must be voted by the Faculty Council.\\n(The action taken by the Honor Council is a vote of requirement to withdraw with a\\nrecommendation to the Faculty Council that the student be expelled.)

Choice of affiliation must be indicated on the\\nHousing Cancellation form. This option to affiliate with the Dudley Community has appealed to\\na number of students, including married students, upper-level students returning from extended\\nleaves of absence, and students who wish to be part of a fully nonresidential community.\\n\\nAll first-year students who complete the fall term must enter the Rising Sophomore Lottery to\\nreceive a House assignment before requesting approval to live off campus. Should they decide\\nto live off campus in their sophomore year, and never live in the House they were affiliated with,\\nthey will automatically be affiliated with the Dudley Community. Students who elect to live in the\\nDudley Cooperative are required to affiliate with the Dudley Community.\\n\\nVISITING UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS\\nThose students who are admitted to Harvard as visitors for a term or a year are admitted as\\nnonresidents, although a small number of beds may be available to these students on a yearly\\nbasis under the oversight of the Dudley Community.\\n\\nDUDLEY COMMUNITY\\nStudents who elect membership in the Dudley Community are eligible for partial or full meal\\ncontracts and are included in all social and cultural activities sponsored by the Dudley\\nCommunity. They are advised and supported by the Dudley Community Resident Dean and are\\nadvised for purposes of fellowship and professional school application by Dudley Community\\ntutors.'),\n",

In a residential college, an individual student’s\\nmedical illness or behavioral difficulties may affect not only that individual, but also others in the\\ncommunity. How these issues may affect a student’s enrollment is discussed elsewhere in this\\nHandbook (see “Involuntary Leaves of Absence”). The principles of consultation outlined here\\nare based on the central importance of preserving suitable living arrangements for all residents,\\nwhile recognizing that each situation is unique, and that fundamental principles, rather than\\nironclad rules, must govern consultation and decision- making on residential life.\\n\\nRESPONSIBILITIES OF HEALTH AND COUNSELING SERVICES\\nMedical care and medical decision-making.\\nMedical care and medical decision-making are the province of clinicians. Thus, in consultation\\nwith patients, clinicians recommend hospitalization, arrange procedures, prescribe medications,\\nconduct psychological evaluations, and recommend and implement ongoing treatment. Harvard\\nUniversity Health Services (HUHS) preserves the rights to privacy and confidentiality of students\\nunder its care, communicating with others about students only with those students’ knowledge\\nand consent, except as noted below (see “Confidentiality and Consent”).\\n\\nIn addition to providing student health and counseling services, HUHS also acts occasionally as\\nconsultants to the College, advising College officers about individual students’ needs, ordinarily\\nwith students’ full knowledge and consent. Three situations that routinely call for close\\ncoordination and consultation between HUHS and the College involve accommodations for\\nstudents experiencing difficulties, clearance to return to residence and enrollment, and leave of\\nabsence considerations. A student with a medical illness or exhibiting behavior that affects\\nfunctioning may need professional evaluation of the condition to determine the appropriateness\\nof temporary or ongoing arrangements, relief or exception to academic requirements, or\\naccommodations, until adequate functioning is restored. In response to a request from a\\nstudent’s Resident Dean or the DAO, HUHS clinicians may evaluate a student’s condition and\\nmake recommendations to the College. In making such recommendations, HUHS clinicians will\\nnot ordinarily disclose information they know independently about a student’s medical or mental\\nhealth condition without the student’s consent and, in all cases, will not disclose information\\nabout the student that is not relevant to the recommendations.\\n\\nExceptional circumstances.\\n\\nIn certain circumstances it may not be possible or advisable for professional staff at HUHS to\\nobtain a student’s consent to a disclosure of health or health-related information.\\nCircumstances worthy of note including the following:\\n\\n• Danger to Any Person\\n\\nOne exception to obtaining a student’s consent is the rare instance in which a student’s\\nmedical condition or behavioral disturbance poses a danger to the student or threat to others\\nor to the community.

If Harvard College has reason to believe that a student may be in a medical facility,\\nthe School may contact HUHS regarding a student’s whereabouts. The HUHS clinician\\nordinarily will disclose only that the student is safely in care. When, in an HUHS clinician’s\\nmedical judgment, a student is in a life-threatening condition, or is psychologically unstable,\\nor has sustained an illness or injury that likely will result in a hospital admission or require\\ncare after discharge, that clinician will notify the College, or a Harvard College administrator.\\nOnly information regarding the fact of the admission/discharge, location of the student,\\ngeneral medical condition, and prospects for return to enrollment or residence is shared;\\ninformation regarding diagnosis or treatment is not shared. Students who are hospitalized or\\nare receiving emergency care are expected to update HUHS; when the hospitalization or\\nemergency room visit raises serious questions about the student’s health or well-being, the\\nstudent ordinarily will be assessed regarding suitability to return to enrollment or residence\\n(See “Clearance for Return”).\\n\\nWhen HUHS is aware that a student who has been hospitalized or received emergency\\ntreatment decides to leave a medical facility against medical advice, an HUHS clinician may\\napprise Harvard College of this decision, if in the clinician’s judgment the student’s decision\\nmay pose a significant risk of physical or emotional danger to the student or to members of\\nthe community.

When\\nconsidering the situation of a student who has an illness or is exhibiting behavior that affects\\nfunctioning, Harvard College may need professional evaluation of the condition to determine\\nappropriate next steps.

This commitment is reflected in the expectations outlined below for\\nstudents as members of our College community and members of undergraduate organizations.\\nDiscrimination based on race, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, creed,\\nnational origin, age, ancestry, veteran status, disability, military service, or any other legally\\nprotected basis is contrary to the principles and policies of Harvard University. (See “Non-\\nDiscrimination and Anti-Bullying” and “Unrecognized and Non-Harvard Organizations”).\\n\\nHarvard College categorizes student organizations in the following way:\\n\\n§ Independent Student Organizations (ISOs). ISOs receive designated benefits from the\\nCollege, are responsible for meeting filing requirements with the Dean of Students\\nOffice, and are accountable to the College for responsible use of those benefits.\\n§ Department Sponsored Student Organizations (DSSOs): DSSOs are led, organized, or\\nsponsored by University departments, offices, or units and thus do not meet the\\ndefinition of recognized Independent Student Organizations. DSSOs receive designated\\nbenefits afforded to ISOs and file with the Dean of Students Office to obtain access to\\nthose benefits.\\n§ Recognized Social Organizations (RSOs): RSOs are organizations composed primarily\\nof Harvard College undergraduates, whose purpose is primarily social and which do not\\ndiscriminate on the basis of gender. RSOs work closely with the Dean of Students Office\\nto be considered for, and to maintain, their recognition.\\n§ Unrecognized or Non-Harvard Organizations: As these organizations are not\\nrecognized, the College does not provide them with access, support, or benefits.\\nIndividual students involved in such organizations remain subject to the College’s\\npolicies including the policy regarding unrecognized organizations discussed further\\nbelow.\\n\\nFor more on these categories and the process by which they are governed, see the Student\\nOrganization Resource Guide.\\n\\nUnrecognized and Non-Harvard Organizations\\nThe regulations for ISOs require they maintain local autonomy. This means all policy decisions\\nmust be made without obligation to any parent organization. The regulations also require ISOs\\nto comply with the University’s policy that discrimination based on race, gender identity, sexual\\norientation, religion, creed, national origin, age, ancestry, veteran status, disability, military\\nservice, or any other legally protected basis is contrary to the principles and policies of Harvard\\nUniversity (see “Non-Discrimination and Anti-Bullying”). In this way, the independence and\\nintegrity of the College are maintained.\\n\\nFrom time to time, undergraduates raise questions about their membership in unrecognized or\\nnon-Harvard organizations. It is important students make well-informed decisions when\\nconsidering membership in these organizations. Organizations defined as non-Harvard or as\\nunrecognized organizations are not permitted to conduct any activity at Harvard even though\\ntheir activities involve Harvard undergraduates.\\n\\nHowever, in special circumstances, unrecognized student organizations whose membership\\nconsists entirely of Harvard College undergraduates may, at the discretion of a particular\\nHarvard office or department, be permitted to co-sponsor educational programs organized by'),\n",

See https://dso.college.harvard.edu/student-organizations.\\n\\nReligion\\nThe ability to express one’s views regarding religion is a significant freedom of speech that the\\nCollege upholds. In some instances, this type of expression becomes an avenue for persuasion\\nto affiliate with a particular religion. Discussion in this vein is prohibited when the educational\\nand work environment of an individual or the community is jeopardized. Harassment is defined\\nas actions on the part of an individual or group that demean or abuse another individual\\nbecause of religious beliefs or that continue after the affected individual has requested a\\ntermination of that type of discussion. In all instances in which a particular religion sponsors an\\nevent or discussion, the individual or group initiating such contact must clearly identify its\\nsponsorship or the sectarian religious nature of its agenda.\\n\\nOn occasion, students have expressed concerns about feeling pressure to join a particular\\nreligious organization. The Harvard Chaplains, the interfaith association of chaplains at Harvard,\\nare attuned to some of the issues related to religious recruitment through high-pressure tactics\\nand can offer suggestions for intervention and prevention.

In addition to the cancellation fee,\\nhousing and food charges are prorated and continue to the day a student leaves College\\nresidence. During the academic year, cancellation of housing and food charges is contingent on\\nsubmitting the proper paperwork to the Housing Office. Students who move off-campus during\\nthe academic year must submit the proper paperwork via the online Residential Portal to the\\nHousing Office; however, the complete Student Services fee continues to be assessed. For\\nstudents who do not fall into one of the above categories (i.e., a leave of absence, a\\nrequirement to withdraw, or a move off-campus) but who are absent from Cambridge for\\nwhatever reason, housing and food charges continue to be assessed through the end of the\\nterm. When a student moves into on- campus housing from off-campus during the academic\\nyear, housing rent and food charges will be assessed from the day the student takes up\\nresidence in the College. Full food charges are prorated to the day that the student moves on\\ncampus.

This responsibility includes\\nreviewing student accounts on my.harvard upon receipt of an account notification each month\\nand making sure that payments are made by the due dates. Students must ensure that parents\\nand others who make payments on their behalf are able to access the student account. Tuition\\nand fees must be paid in full in order for students to enroll in classes each term. The College\\nmay deny enrollment to those students whose charges are not paid by the established\\ndeadlines. Payments for Commencement, and for the November and March degree periods,\\nmust also be made by the designated due dates. No degree can be conferred until all\\nindebtedness to the University is paid in full. Additional charges that may be added to the\\nstudent account after degrees are conferred must also be paid in full.\\n\\nAmount Due\\nThe amount due includes all charges on the student’s account on my.harvard that have not\\nbeen paid, and are not being covered by anticipated aid. Email notifications are sent when new\\ncharges are added to the account, or when charges are due within the next two weeks. Charges\\nfor the fall term are added to the student account in July with a payment due date in mid-August.\\nSpring term charges are added to the account in December and due in January. Upon receipt of\\nthe first account notification, students are expected to review the transactions and set up\\nparents and all others (besides sponsors) who need access to the account as delegates. Once\\nset up, delegates will also receive account notifications. More detailed information is available\\non the University Student Financial Services website or by emailing\\nstudent_billing@harvard.edu.\\n\\nMonthly Payment Plan\\nThe University offers a monthly payment plan that allows eligible students to pay tuition and\\nrequired fees in four monthly installments each term. Under this plan, fall term installments are\\ndue in August, September, October, and November. Spring term installments are due in\\nJanuary, February, March, and April. There is a $35 charge per term for use of this plan.\\n\\nAny balance due from a prior term must be paid in full before students can enroll in the payment\\nplan. Once enrolled, payment plan installments must be paid by the due date each month.'),\n",

The officials who maintain\\nthese records are those in charge of the functions reflected in the records and the offices where\\nthe records are kept.

Students wishing access to their education records should contact\\nthe Registrar’s Office. Ordinarily, students are asked to submit a written request that identifies\\nthe specific record or records they wish to inspect. Access will be given within 45 days from\\nreceipt of the request. When a record contains information about more than one student, the\\nstudent requesting access may inspect and review only the portion of the record relating to\\nthemselves. Students also are not permitted to view letters and statements of recommendation\\nto which they waived their right of access, or that were placed in their file before January 1,\\n1975.\\nStudents should direct any questions they have about the accuracy of records to the person in\\ncharge of the office where the records are kept. If questions still remain, the matter may be\\nreferred to the Associate Registrar for Operations in the Registrar’s Office. Should it be\\nnecessary, a hearing may be held to resolve challenges concerning the accuracy of records in\\nthose cases where informal discussions have not satisfactorily settled the questions raised.\\n\\nDirectory Information\\nThe FAS regards the following information as “directory information,” that is, information that,\\nunder FERPA, can be made available to the general public: full name; reported date of birth;\\ndates of attendance; concentration; class year; digitized image (please note that while Harvard\\nclassifies photos and images as directory information, these are rarely released to parties\\noutside the University without the student’s permission); local or campus residence address and\\ntelephone number; University email address; secondary school (for College students);\\nundergraduate college (for GSAS students); home town or city at the time the application for\\nadmission was filed by the student; original class at time of matriculation; degree candidate\\nstatus; date of graduation (actual or expected); degree(s) received with field of concentration\\nand level of honors granted (if any); department of study; University prizes, fellowships, and\\nsimilar honors awarded; and, in certain cases, students’ and parents’ or guardians’ home\\naddresses and telephone numbers.
